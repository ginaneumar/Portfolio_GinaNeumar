        <p>
          Our task in my project is to design our own product in the form of an
          app, test it and go through the human-centered design process. Our
          product should serve the purpose of promoting sustainable consumption
          through digital product information; as a project of the Federal
          Environment Agency. I then decided after research for the supermarket
          "Edeka".
          <br />
          <br />
          Because when you turn over a product, you don't clearly know how
          sustainable it is!
        </p>
        <h1>Goal</h1>
        <p>
          I set myself the goal of designing a sustainable version of an Edeka,
          where food should be searched for or scanned and then all sustainable
          information can be read.

        I decided on 3 personas because everyone in this age group goes grocery
        shopping. But also each of these age groups has different needs as well
        as problems that i want to consider in the design.

          I want to create an intuitive design for the smartphone. The 5 buttons
          at the bottom should make it easy to use. I have also first
          concentrated on the essential things that should be present in the
          design in any case: A history on the home page, a scan button to get
          all the sustainable information of the product that was scanned, an
          information page where it is exclusively about sustainability, seals
          or the like.

          I used my sketches as a guide for creating wireframes during my design

          navigation, because that way you can tell, on which page you are on.

        <h1>High-fidelity Prototype</h1>
        <p>
          In the high fidelity prototype you can already see how the app can
          actually look like. I developed a points system from 0.0 - 10.0 that
          shows how sustainable a product really is, while you can also read the
          individual details again.

      </div>
      <div class="image-wrapper">
        <img src="edeka/P1.png" alt="Image 1" />
        <p>
          I have designed several more screens when you open the app for the
          first time. You can log in or register first, but of course you can
          also continue without any registration. Here you can also see the
          designed logo that brings sustainability and Edeka together.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="image-wrapper">
        <img src="edeka/P2.png" alt="Image 2" />
        <p>
          On the home page, you have Card that shows you your history of what
          you've searched or scanned before, so you can access it again
          afterwards. The cards can also be placed one below the other.
          <br /><br />Under Search you can now see the correct categories and
          the last searched examples. <br /><br />Under Information you can find
          information about sustainability in general and about the seals. Or an
          exact explanation of the sustainability scale that I have created.

        <img src="edeka/P3.png" alt="Image 3" />
        <p>
          The scan button is meant for barcodes, when you are in the supermarket
          you open the app and click on the scan button to get all the
          information about the sustainability of the selected product. You get
          information about sustainability: means origin, CO2 emissions,
          environmental / social sustainability and a Good to Know section. And
          finally you have a profile page (if you have decided to register).

          One challenge of this project was to create a good UI design for a few
          pages, it was fun but I also had trouble working pixel perfect at the
          beginning.

          <br /><br />I also enjoyed working freely, realizing my own design
          ideas and achieving a good result in the end.
