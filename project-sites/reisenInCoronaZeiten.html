        <p>
          The task of the project is to design a Website or App that people can
          travel safe in Germany while Corona. It is the first project where I
          should do a design run through. Here I learned about the context of
          use, interviews, personas, wireframe, prototypes and usability.
        </p>
        <h1>Goal</h1>
        <p>
          The goal was to create a website that allows users to travel during
          Corona and get all the necessary information from our website.

              Laura is a student who likes to travel to explore new places and
              pursue her hobby of photography. While Corona was she actually not
              travel at all, because her grandmother is pre-sick and thus does
              not want to face any risk. Since she has no plans to travel
              anytime soon, a website is good but she doesn't depend on it.

              Lukas loves traveling regularly with his family. During Corona he
              willingly renounced, but he missed it very simply to take the time
              of a few days. A website would be very helpful for him to find out
              exactly where it is safe to go.

          For the wireframe we followed the sketch very closely. We were
          supposed to work with Balsamiq and Axure among others. We added some
          content to the wireframe to be clear about how we want to represent
          something and how useful it is.

        <p>
          For our final prototype, we decided on a color scheme of light blue,
          black and gray. The map of Germany has an orange to red color to show
          how many corona infections there are currently in these areas.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="image-wrapper">
        <img src="corona/prototyp1.png" alt="Image 1" />
        <p>
          On the start page you can directly see the map of Germany and the
          filter for it. You can filter by activities, new infections, price
          class, federal state, distance and measures. If you then apply the
          filter, you can see the various accommodations, etc. that offer all
          this and you can see the marker for it on the map.
          <br />
          <br />
          Of course it is possible to click on a marker to get more detailed
          information.

        <img src="corona/prototyp2.png" alt="Image 2" />
        <p>
          There are also pages for the travel checklist and current Corona news.
          <br />
          <br />
          You can either check off the travel checklist directly on the website
          or download and print it.

        <p>
          In our project, it was also important to include accessibility, and
          that you can control these issues in the settings.

        <h1>What did I learn</h1>
        <p>
          It was the first time we got a real job for a design. Thereby I gained
          an insight into what the process of a designer is like. Here I could
          also work with Balsamiq and Axure for the first time. With this
          project I also realized how much fun I have with this kind of projects
          and its process.
